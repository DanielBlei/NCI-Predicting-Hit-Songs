# Predicting Hit Songs Using Spotify's Audio Features.

## This research had a non-commercial purpose of studying the possibility of creating a classification model that successfully predicts hit songs based on quantitative data of audio tracks provided by Spotifyâ€™s Audio Features. The process involved the use of data mining and data analysis techniques to acquire a dataset, analyse the data collected, transform or create new attributes and build a classification model based on the majority vote of an ensemble of algorithms. 

## The final model was evaluated with the presentation of a new dataset to be predicted and the use of a series of data mining metrics to deeply understand the provided results.
